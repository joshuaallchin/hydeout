## Description
Dynamic Analyses run for a newly erected sign that had structurally failed. A series of modal analyses found the source of the problem to be undersized members for the wind loading applied.

### Assumptions

### Strand7 Model

Strand7 does not have a simple way to display an entire modal analysis in a similar manner to SpaceGass but the output can be ported in to EXCEL for graphic presentation.
